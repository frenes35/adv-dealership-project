# Project Title

adv-dealership-project

## Description of the Project

This Java console application is designed to manage the inventory, sales, and leasing operations of a car dealership.
Users can search vehicles based on various criteria such as price, model, year, and other attributes.
Additionally, the application allows users to add new vehicles to the inventory, remove existing vehicles,
and record customer information and contract details (for sales or leases).

The intended users of this application are small-scale car dealership owners and their employees.
It aims to help dealership staff easily track vehicles in inventory and manage customer contracts efficiently,
ultimately streamlining day-to-day inventory and contract management tasks.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to buy a vehicle so that I can complete the purchase and own the car.
- As a user, I want to lease a vehicle so that I can drive it temporarily without buying it.
- As a user, I want to see the estimated monthly lease payment based on my lease term choice so I understand the cost.
- As a user, I want to review the contract before finalizing my lease or purchase so that I am clear on the terms.
